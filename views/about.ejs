			<h1>About Safe For Work Me</h1>
			<p>The SFWMe project was created as a simple tool (with <a href="/api">API</a>) to allow anyone to quickly shorten a <span class="text-danger">NSFW</span> (<span class="text-danger">N</span>ot <span class="text-danger">S</span>afe <span class="text-danger">F</span>or <span class="text-danger">W</span>ork) link. 

			Use this as much as you like to avoid those awkward situations when you don't know where someone will open your link. In an increasingly mobile device driven world where employees are opening awkward links in front of their bosses all over the place.

			I hope you find some use in this tool. Otherwise, I did this for nothing. </p>

			<h1>Advertisers</h1>
			<p>There is a small advertising opportunity on SFWMe. You may advertise your link on the "get-away link" found on the redirection page for SFWMe (see example below). If you are interested in pricing and details you may <a href="mailto:kareemsal@gmail.com">contact me</a> for more info.</p>
